# HoughtTransformandK-meansClustering
Python language / OpenCV library / Image Processing


 My aim is our to use the K-means clustering method and the Hough 
Transform to detect and segment leaves in an input picture. We can identify and analyze the leaves in 
the image using these approaches. For both of the tasks, we apply the same methods only the input 
image changes.
